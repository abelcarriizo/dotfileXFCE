##Introduction    
  
The Cupertino Effect in Black is based on the Cupertino series, which was designed to mimic the appearance of the macOS dock itself, but giving a unique look and feel with my own adaptive design.  
  
**Cupertino Series**  
This series includes 7 different Plank dock themes. You find it all at [Artwork e Design - Cupertino Series](https://artworkedesign.wordpress.com/tag/cupertino-series/).
